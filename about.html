    <p>Hi! My name is Keith Lee, and I am a product manager!</p> 
    <p>I started web development in pursuit of improving my technical skills to help support my career as a product manager. I have historically worked with Javascript and SQL in previous employment, and I am currently studying web development and iOS app development (Swift and SwiftUI).</p>
    <br>
    <p>I am a loving husband to a Dungeons and Dragons enthusiast, and a father to two beautiful...dogs.</p>
